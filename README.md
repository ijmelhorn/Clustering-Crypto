PCA and K-Means Clustering Algorithms

Created an analysis of what cryptocurrencies are available to trade and how they can be grouped using classification and unsupervised learning algorithms.

## Overview ##
- Prepared data for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means.

- Reduced data dimension using the principal component algorithm from sklearn.

- Predicted clusters in the cryptocurrency data using the K-Means algorithm from sklearn.

- Created plots and data tables to present results using hvplot and plotly.
